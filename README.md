- Hi, I’m @brandonhippe (Brandon Hippe)
- I'm a Computer Engineering student at Portland State University, in my first year of Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I have my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from Portland State University.
- I use my repositories for homework, and I also have some code I've written for Advent of Code here as well
