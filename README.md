- I'm in my second year of PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Villanova University working on Silicon Photonics for Low-Power IoT Devices. I have my Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Bachelor's in Computer Engineering, both from Portland State University.
- I use my repositories for homework and personal projects such as Advent of Code.
