- Hi, I’m @brandonhippe (Brandon Hippe)
- I'm in my first year of PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Portland State University and working with the [WEST Lab](https://web.pdx.edu/~dburnett/) on Silicon Photonics for Low-Power IoT Devices. I have my Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Bachelor's in Computer Engineering, both from Portland State University.
- I use my repositories for homework and personal projects such as Advent of Code. Also check out the Indoor Air Quality Monitor repo (my undergrad Senior Capstone project) with I currently maintain.
